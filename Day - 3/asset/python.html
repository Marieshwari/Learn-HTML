    <p ><i>Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. 
        <br>It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.<br>
         Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables<br>
          are instances (object) of these classes.<br></i></p>

        <p><i>Anything is said to be mutable when anything can be modified or changed. The term <b>"mutable" </b>in Python refers to an object's capacity to modify its values. These are frequently the things that hold a data collection.</i></p>

        <p><i>Immutable refers to a state in which no change can occur over time. A Python object is referred to as immutable if we cannot change its value over time. The value of these Python objects is fixed once they are made..</i></p>
