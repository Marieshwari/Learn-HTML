        <h3 align="center">BEAR</h3>
        <p><i><b>Bears</b> are carnivoran mammals of the family<b> Ursidae</b> (/ˈɜːrsɪdiː, -daɪ/). They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of <b>North America, South America,</b> and Eurasia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair,<b> plantigrade </b>paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.

            While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda is mostly herbivorous, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varying diets. With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically <b>solitary animals.</b> They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent <b>sense of smell.</b> Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers. Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of<b> hibernation,</b> up to 100 days.</i></p>

        <h3 align="center">DOG</h3>
        <p><i>The<b> dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) </b>is a <b>domesticated</b> descendant </b>of the wolf. Also called the <b>domestic dog,</b> it is derived from extinct <b>Pleistocene wolves,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be domesticated[9][8] by humans. <b>Hunter-gatherers</b> did this, over 15,000 years ago in Germany,[7] which was before the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other <b>canids</b>.[11]

            The dog has been<b> selectively bred</b> over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[12]<b> Dog breeds </b>vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as <b>hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people</b>. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.[13] This influence on human society has given them the <b>sobriquet</b> of ><b>"man's best friend"</b>.[14].</i></p>

        <h3 align="center">PIG</h3>
        <p><i>The pig (Sus domesticus), often called swine (pl.: swine), hog, or domestic pig when distinguishing from other members of the genus Sus, is an omnivorous, domesticated, even-toed, hoofed mammal. It is variously considered a subspecies of Sus scrofa (the wild boar or Eurasian boar) or a distinct species. The pig's head-plus-body length ranges from 0.9 to 1.8 m (3 to 6 ft), and adult pigs typically weigh between 50 and 350 kg (110 and 770 lb), with well-fed individuals even exceeding this range. The size and weight of hogs largely depends on their breed. Compared to other artiodactyls, a pig's head is relatively long and pointed. Most even-toed ungulates are herbivorous, but pigs are omnivores, like their wild relative. Pigs grunt and make snorting sounds.

            When used as livestock, pigs are farmed primarily for the production of meat, called pork. A group of pigs is called a passel, a team, or a sounder. The animal's bones, hide, and bristles are also used in products. Pigs, especially miniature breeds, are kept as pets.<i></p>
