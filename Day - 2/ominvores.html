            <p><i>Vertebrate, any animal of the subphylum Vertebrata, the predominant subphylum of the phylum Chordata.<br>   They have backbones, from which they derive their name. The vertebrates are also characterized by a muscular system consisting primarily of bilaterally paired masses and a central nervous system partly enclosed within the backbone.<br> 

                The subphylum is one of the best known of all groups of animals. <br>Its members include the classes Agnatha, Chondrichthyes, and Osteichthyes (all fishes); Amphibia (amphibians); Reptilia (reptiles); Aves (birds); and Mammalia (mammals).Although the vertebral column is perhaps the most obvious vertebrate feature, it was not present in the first vertebrates, which probably had only a notochord.<br> The vertebrate has a distinct head, with a differentiated tubular brain and three pairs of sense organs (nasal, optic, and otic). The body is divided into trunk and tail regions.<br> The presence of pharyngeal slits with gills indicates a relatively high metabolic rate. A well-developed notochord enclosed in perichordal connective tissue, with a tubular spinal cord in a connective tissue canal above it, <br>is flanked by a number of segmented muscle masses. A sensory ganglion develops on the dorsal root of the spinal nerve, and segmental autonomic ganglia grow below the notochord. The trunk region is filled with a large, bilateral body cavity (coelom) with contained viscera, and this coelom extends anteriorly into the visceral arches. A digestive system consists of an esophagus extending from the pharynx to the stomach and a gut from the stomach to the anus. A distinct heart, anteroventral to the liver, is enclosed in a pericardial sac. </i></p>
