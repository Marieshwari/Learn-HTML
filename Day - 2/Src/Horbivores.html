        <h3 align="center">DEER</h3>
        <p><i>A<b> deer</b> (pl.: deer) or <b>true deer</b> is a hoofed ruminant mammal of the<b> family Cervidae.</b> The two main groups of deer are the Cervinae, including<b> muntjac, elk</b> (wapiti), red deer, and fallow deer; and the Capreolinae, including reindeer (caribou),<b> white-tailed deer, roe deer,</b> and<b> moose.</b> Male deer of all species (except the water deer), as well as female reindeer, grow and shed new antlers each year. In this, they differ from permanently horned antelope, which are part of a different family (Bovidae) within the same order of <b>even-toed ungulates</b> (Artiodactyla).

            The<b> musk deer (Moschidae)</b> of Asia and chevrotains (Tragulidae) of tropical African and Asian forests are separate families that are also in the ruminant clade Ruminantia; they are not especially closely related to Cervidae.Deer appear in art from Paleolithic cave paintings onwards, and they have <b>played a role in mythology,</b> religion, and literature throughout history, as well as in heraldry, such as red deer that appear in the coat of arms of Åland.[2] Their economic importance includes the use of their meat as venison, their skins as soft, <b>strong buckskin,</b> and their antlers as handles for knives. Deer hunting has been a popular activity since the Middle Ages and remains a resource for many families today.</i></p>

        <h3 align="center">GIRAFFE</h3>
        <p><i>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus <b>Giraffa.</b> It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the <b>largest ruminant</b> on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa <b>camelopardalis,</b> with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.

            The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely <b>long neck and legs,</b> its horn-like ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns. It is classified under the <b>family Giraffidae,</b> along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is<b> leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants,</b> primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.
            
            Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes..</i></p>

        <h3 align="center">ELEPHANT</h3>
        <p><i>Elephants have been <b>working animals </b>since at least the<b> Indus Valley civilization</b> over 4,000 years ago[157] and continue to be used in modern times. There were 13,000–16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000. These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old when they are both more trainable and can work for more years.[158] They were <b>traditionally captured with traps and lassos</b>, but since 1950, <b>tranquillisers</b> have been used.[159] Individuals of the Asian species have been often trained as working animals. Asian elephants are used to carry and pull both objects and people in and out of areas as well as lead people in religious celebrations. They are valued over mechanised tools as they can perform the same tasks but in more difficult terrain, with strength, memory, and delicacy. Elephants can learn over 30 commands.[158] Musth bulls are difficult and dangerous to work with and so are chained up until their condition passes.[160]

            In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under<b> The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960</b>.</i></p>
