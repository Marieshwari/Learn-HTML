        <p><i>Lions are part of a<b> group of exotic animals</b> that have been central to
             zoo exhibits since the late 18th century. Although many modern zoos are more selective
              about their exhibits,[214] there are more than<b> 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos </b>and wildlife parks around the world. They are considered an ambassador species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes.[215] Lions can<b> live over twenty years </b>in captivity; for example, three <b>sibling lions</b> at the Honolulu Zoo lived to the age of 22 in 2007.[216][217]

            The first European<b> "zoos" </b>spread among noble and royal families in the 13th century,
             and until the 17th century were called seraglios. At that time, they came to be called menageries,
              an extension of the cabinet of curiosities. They spread from France and Italy during the Renaissance
               to the rest of Europe.[218] In England, although the<b>seraglio tradition</b> was less developed, 
               lions were kept at the<b> Tower of London</b> in a seraglio established by King John in the 13th 
               century;[219][220] this was probably stocked with animals from an earlier menagerie started in 1125
                by Henry I at his hunting lodge in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, where according to <b>William of
                     Malmesbury lions</b> had been stocked.[221]</i></p>

        <h3 align="center">TIGER</h3>
        <p><i>The tiger<b> (Panthera tigris)</b> is the largest living<b> cat</b> species and a member of the genus <b>Panthera</b>. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An<b> apex predator</b>, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and<b> wild boar</b>. It is territorial and generally a <b>solitary but social predator,</b> requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own.

            The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758. It once ranged widely from the<b> Eastern Anatolia Region</b> in the west to the<b> Amur River</b> basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been<b> extirpated</b> from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. What remains of the range where tigers still roam free is fragmented, stretching in spots from<b> Siberian temperate forests </b>to subtropical and <b>tropical forests </b>on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and a single .</i></p>

        <h3 align="center"> WOLF</h3>
        <p><i>The wolf (Canis lupus;[b] pl.: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a <b>large canine</b> native to Eurasia and North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog and dingo, though <b>gray wolves,</b> as popularly understood, only comprise <b>naturally-occurring</b> wild subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of the <b>family Canidae,</b> and is further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and <b>muzzle, </b>as well as a shorter torso and a<b> longer tail.</b> The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. The wolf's fur is usually mottled<b> white, brown, gray, and black,</b> although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.
