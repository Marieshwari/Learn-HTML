      <p><i>The State emblem is an adaptation from the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka. In the original pillar, there are four lions, standing back to back, mounted on an abacus with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull and a lion separated by intervening wheels over a bell-shaped lotus. Carved out of a single block of polished sandstone, the Capital is crowned by the Wheel of the Law (Dharma Chakra).

        In the state emblem, adopted by the Government of India on 26 January 1950, only three lions are visible, the fourth being hidden from view. The wheel appears in relief in the centre of the abacus with a bull on right and a horse on left and the outlines of other wheels on extreme right and left. The bell-shaped lotus has been omitted. The words Satyameva Jayate from Mundaka Upanishad, meaning <b>'Truth Alone Triumphs', </b>are inscribed below the abacus in Devanagari script.

        <img src="./image/flag-removebg-preview (1).png" width="180px" height="150px" align="left">
       <p><i>The National Flag is a horizontal tricolour of<b> deep saffron</b> (kesaria) at the top, <b>white </b>in the middle and<b> dark green</b> at the bottom in equal proportions. The ratio of width of the flag to its length is two to three. In the centre of the white band is a navy-blue wheel which represents the chakra. Its design is that of the wheel which appears on the abacus of the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka. Its diameter approximates to the width of the white band and it has<b> 24 spokes.</b> The design of the National Flag was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 22 July 1947.

       <p><i>The magnificent tiger, Panthera tigris, is a striped animal. It has a thick yellow coat of fur with dark stripes.

        The combination of<b> grace, strength,</b> agility and enormous power has earned the tiger its pride of place as the National Animal of India.
        
        Out of the eight known races of the species, the Indian race—the Royal Bengal Tiger, is found throughout the country except in the north-western region and also in the neighbouring countries—Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh.
        
        To check the dwindling population of tigers in India, ‘Project Tiger' was launched in April 1973. So far, 27 tiger reserves have been established in the country under this project, covering an area of 37,761 sq km.

       <p>The National Bird of India—the Indian peacock, Pavo cristatus, is a <b>colourful,</b> swan-sized bird with a fan-shaped crest of feathers, a white patch under the eye and a long, slender neck. The male of the species is more colourful than the female with a glistening blue breast and neck and a spectacular bronze-green tail of around 200 elongated feathers. The female is brownish, slightly smaller than the male and lacks the tail.

        The elaborate courtship dance of the male, fanning out the tail and preening its feathers is a gorgeous sight.

       <p>Indian fig tree, Ficus bengalensis, is the National Tree of India, whose branches root themselves like new trees over a large area. The roots then give rise to more <b>trunks and branches.</b>

        Due to this characteristic and its longevity, this tree is considered immortal and is an integral part of the myths and legends of India.
        
        Even today, the banyan tree is the focal point of <b>village life and the village council meets</b> under the shade of this tree.
